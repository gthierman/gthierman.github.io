## Introduction
Lawyers prioritize efficiency. In his study [“Herding Cats: The Lawyer Personality Revealed”](http://online.fliphtml5.com/vtfh/wuia/), psychologist Dr. Larry Richard indentified that lawyers “seek efficiency and economy in everything from conversations to case management to relationships." This was clear in feedback our customers (names omitted to protect privacy) were giving us:

> “The screens are HUGE - like when you enter a new matter or client information - you used to be able to see all the info on one page and now you have to scroll down”<br>
<cite>-- Clio customer</cite>

>“I like lots of information in a single screen…so I can potentially see what I need to see without scrolling too much.”<br>
<cite>-- Clio customer</cite>

> “There’s just so much whitespace everywhere. You can spend endless time scrolling. It’s so unnecessary. This is very pretty and clean, but it’s not very efficient.”<br>
<cite>-- Clio customer</cite>

This case study will focus on how I redesigned one of the most used layouts in Clio, the datatable layout, to use screen space more efficiently.


## Problems

### Too many levels of navigation
There are 5 levels of navigation pushing the content down the page. The content the customer actually cares about doesn’t start until about halfway down the page. This was the number one problem that needed to be addressed.


### Table rows are too tall
Table rows often have multiple rows of data inside them, in addition to an extra row of action links. These combine to create overly tall table rows that don’t leave much room to display lots of data on the page.

### Key screen real estate not used effectively
Screen real estate, especially on smaller devices, is precious and needs to be used effectively. Much of the most valuable screen real estate on the page is just dead whitespace. Lawyers wanted that space used to show them information they can use.

### Poor affordances
Through our support feedback channel, we knew customers were having trouble understanding that certain elements were clickable, and would often miss key functionality on the page because of this. They often didn’t realize that tabs were tabs, for example.

### Sidebar takes up alot of real estate

## Constraints
To minimize confusing for customers I was directed not to change the navigation structure if possible.

## Mockups

### Low fidelity
The next step was to start mocking up different UI possibilities in low fidelity. The goal here was to explore different variations -- top nav, side nav, and

### High fidelity
We then created a few higher fidelity mockups.
