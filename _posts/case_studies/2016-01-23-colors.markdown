intro: Over the years, Clio's design language has evolved, and the colors in use and the CSS that powers it had grown, with little thought paid to maintenance. By 2017, it was in bad need of an overhaul.

## Problems

* Too many color variables
* Hardcoded values
* Poor accessibility and non-adherence to guidelines

### Too many colors
The palette had become tremendously bloated with variations of the same colour. Multiple reds, blues, greens, and greys.

This is a snippet from the Clio SCSS variables file - way too many variables in play. It's hard for designers and developers to know what color to use, and it's hard to maintain and update:

### Hardcoded colors
Alot of the CSS was written before Clio was using SCSS variables, so colors were hardcoded â€“ an absolute nightmare to maintain.
{% highlight scss %}
// Examples from the master file of hardcoded color values
.settings a {
  color: #0000ee;
}
.settings-submenu li .selected {
  background: #e5e5e7;
}
{% endhighlight %}

## Step 1: Audit

## Step 2: Convert

## Step 3: Document

## Documenting the system

## Adding secondary palette
