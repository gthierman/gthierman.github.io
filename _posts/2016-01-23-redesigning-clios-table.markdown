  <p>The main Clio product made widespread use of an older datatable design launched in 2013, and customers had some common complaints that the team wanted to address.</p>
  <h3>Density</h3>
  <p>Customers complained - a lot - about the whitespace in the Clio user experience.  The datatable especially made poor use of the screen real estate and did not allow customers to see enough rows of data to be productive.</p>
